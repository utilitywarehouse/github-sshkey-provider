# This is an example YAML config file.

# The config file can be written in any format that viper understands
# (https://github.com/spf13/viper) understands and needs to be named like
# `config.ext` (eg. `config.yaml`)

# The config file can be placed in the same path with the binary or in `./conf`

# Configuration values can be overriden using environment variables. The name
# of the environment variables is prefixed by GSKP_, eg:
# githubAccessToken is controlled by GSKP_GITHUBACCESSTOKEN

# The values below are used by the collector to determine which GitHub team

# to have the `read:org` permission.
githubAccessToken: token_to_use_with_the_github_api

# By default, it uses ":6379" to connect to redis (localhost), you can change
# this value by changing the value below.
# redisHost: :6379

# It also assumes the connection to redis is not authenticated. If you need to
# use a password to authenticate with redis, please set it below.
# redisPassword: password

# collectorPollingInterval determines the number of seconds between collection
# cycles (ie. how often the collector will poll the GitHub API)
# collectorPollingInterval: 900
