# This is an example YAML config file.

# The config file can be written in any format that viper understands
# (https://github.com/spf13/viper) understands and needs to be named as the
# environment name: `${UW_ENVIRONMENT}.ext` (eg. `development.yaml`)

# The config file can be placed in the same path with the binary or in `./conf`

# Configuration values can be overriden using environment variables. The name
# of the environment variables is prefixed by GSKP_, eg:
# githubAccessToken is controlled by GSKP_GITHUBACCESSTOKEN

# organizationName is used by the collector to determine which GitHub
# organisation to get teams and users from
organizationName: my_github_organization_name

# This is an access token to be used when talking to the GitHub API. It needs
# to have the `read:org` permission.
githubAccessToken: token_to_use_with_the_github_api

# collectorHTTPAddress set the address on which the collector's internal HTTP
# server will be listening
# collectorHTTPAddress: :3000

# collectorHTTPTimeout sets a timeout (in seconds) for the HTTP server the
# collector uses
# collectorHTTPTimeout: 10

# collectorCacheTTL sets the TTL for cached keys in the collector
# collectorCacheTTL: 300

# collectorRootURL determines the base URL of the collector, which is used by
# the agent
# collectorRootURL: http://localhost:3000/

# Specifies the path to the authorized_keys file that the agent is managing.
# authorizedKeysPath: authorized_keys
