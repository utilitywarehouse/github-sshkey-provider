# This is an example YAML config file.

# The config file can be written in any format that viper understands
# (https://github.com/spf13/viper) understands and needs to be named as the
# environment name: `${UW_ENVIRONMENT}.ext` (eg. `development.yaml`)

# The config file can be placed in the same path with the binary or in `./conf`

# Configuration values can be overriden using environment variables. The name
# of the environment variables is prefixed by GSKP_, eg:
# githubAccessToken is controlled by GSKP_GITHUBACCESSTOKEN

# organizationName is used by the collector to determine which GitHub
# organisation to get teams and users from

# collectorHTTPAddress set the address on which the collector's internal HTTP
# server will be listening
# collectorHTTPAddress: :3000

# the collector uses. It will wait this long for outstanding connections to
# close, before terminating them.
# collectorHTTPTimeout: 10

# collectorCacheTTL sets the TTL for cached keys in the collector
# collectorCacheTTL: 300

# collectorBaseURL determines the base URL of the collector, which is used by
# the agent
# collectorBaseURL: http://localhost:3000/

# agentGithubTeam specifies which GitHub team will be used to compile the list
# of authorized_keys for the agent.

# agentLongpollTimeoutSeconds is used to specify the timeout (in seconds) for
# the longpoll requests the agent makes to the collector. Setting it to 0 means
